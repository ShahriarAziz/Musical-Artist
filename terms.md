Nothing in this Terms creates a partnership, joint venture, agency or employment relationship between Users. Nothing in this Terms shall in any way be construed as forming a joint venture, partnership or a Maker-Hunter relationship between Reviewhunt and any User.

## Reward

Reward is used as payment to a Hunter from a Maker when the hunter’s proof submissions have been approved in the moderation process and accepted by the Maker. All Quests have a set of rules and guidelines ( **"Quest Instruction"**) that Hunters who join must follow in order to gain the rewards. Makers have the right to reject submissions or deny to give rewards if the Hunter has not met the rules and guidelines of the Quest.

A Hunter must read and agree to the Hunters Guidelines before joining a Quest. Any violations of the guidelines may cause a rejection of the Reward distribution and⁄or blacklisted if the actions are serious or frequently attempted.

Hunters shall receive the Reward in the form of USD Point 4 hours after the Hunter's submission is approved by the Maker. The Reward will be distributed to the User’s My Credit section that is managed and controlled by Reviewhunt. All amount of rewards in the My Credit will be constantly monitored. If we find an action from a Hunter that may damage any of Reviewhunt Services and⁄or operation of Quests, or whose actions are considered to be harmful to the quality of the Reviewhunt Service and⁄or operation of Quests, Reviewhunt can suspend the account and remove the entire reward value from the Hunter’s My Credit.

Hunters shall transfer the received Reward to HUNT Token via their External Ether Wallet conducted through the Ethereum Network. Once we have verified the transactions conducted through the Site, the Rewards will be transferred from the My Credit to the External Ether Wallet that is connected to an appropriate Ethereum addresses by the Hunter. With this in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the Site, Reviewhunt, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network.

By utilizing the My Credit transfer, the Site or interacting with the Tools or platform or anything contained or provided therein in any way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage, risks, potential bugs based on novel technology (where applicable), and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, like Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), smart contract based tokens such as those that follow the Ethereum Token Standard (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20) and blockchain-based software systems.

HUNT Tokens are intangible digital assets that exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the ethereum network. Reviewhunt has no control over and makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the ownership record.

By using the site, you accept the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing online over the internet, and agree that Reviewhunt has no liability or responsibility for any breach of security unless it is due to our gross negligence.

Reviewhunt will not be responsible or liable to you for any losses you incur as a result of your use of the ethereum network or any ethereum electronic wallet, including but not limited to any losses, damages or claims arising from: (i) user error, such as forgotten passwords or incorrectly construed smart contracts or other transactions; (ii) server failure or data loss; (iii) corrupted wallet files; or (iv) unauthorized access or activities by third parties, including but not limited to the use of viruses, phishing, bruteforcing or other means of attack against Reviewhunt, Ethereum Network, or the Metamask Electronic Wallet.

Reviewhunt is not responsible for losses due to blockchains or any other features of the Ethereum Network or any Ethereum Electronic Wallet, including but not limited to late report by developers or representatives (or no report at all) of any issues with the blockchain supporting the Ethereum Network, including forks, technical node issues, or any other issues having fund losses as a result.

## Limits & Fraud Prevention

We reserve the right to suspend a User transfer request of his or her Reward if the source of the Reward is suspected to be fraudulent.

If we become aware that any Reward received as a result of a fraudulent transaction, this will be reversed immediately. If those Reward have already been released to you, you must pay the Reward back to Reviewhunt. If you do not do so, we may suspend, limit or cancel your account, or take action against you to recover those Reward.

We may, in our sole discretion, place a limit on any or all of the Reward in your Account (thereby preventing any use of the Reward) if:

1.  we believe there may be an unacceptable level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of your transactions, including if we believe that there is a risk that such Reward will be subject to reversal or chargeback;
2.  we believe that the beneficiary of the payment is someone other than you;
3.  we believe that the reward transfer is being made to a country where we do not offer our Service; or
4.  we are required to do so by law or applicable law enforcement agencies.

If you are involved in a dispute, we may (in certain circumstances) place a temporary limit on the Reward in your Account to cover the amount of any potential liability. If the dispute is resolved in your favor, we will lift the limit on your Reward and those Reward may be released to you. If the dispute is not resolved in your favor, we may remove the Reward from your Account. We may also place a limit on your account in circumstances where we suspect you of fraudulent or other unacceptable behavior, while we investigate any such matter.

## Right to Refuse Service

We may close, suspend or limit your access to your Account without reason. Without limiting the foregoing, we may close, suspend or limit your access to your Account:

1.  if we determine that you have breached, or are acting in breach of, this Terms;
2.  if we determine that you have infringed legal rights (resulting in actual or potential claims);
3.  if we determine that you have engaged, or are engaging, in fraudulent, or illegal activities;
4.  you do not respond to account verification requests;
5.  you do not complete account verification when requested within 3 months of the date of request;
6.  to manage any risk of loss to us, a User, or any other person; or
7.  for any other reason(s).

If we close your Account due to your breach of this Terms, you may also become liable for certain fees as described in this Terms.

Without limiting our other remedies, to the extent you have breached this Terms, you must pay us all fees owed to us and reimburse us for all losses and costs (including any and all of our Hunter time) and reasonable expenses (including legal fees) related to investigating such breach and collecting such fees.

You acknowledge and agree that: (1) the damages that we will sustain as a result of your breach of this Terms will be substantial and will potentially include (without limitation) fines and other related expenses imposed on us by our payment processors and Users and that those damages may be extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain; (2) if you breach this Terms, we may take legal action against you to recover losses.

In the event that we close your Account, you will have no claim whatsoever against us in respect of any such suspension or termination of your Account.

## Blacklist

We run a blacklist to prevent abusing of Rewards from the Quest activities and maintain a fair platform. If you commit any of the following actions, your account will be blacklisted.

1.  Operate multiple alt accounts to submit multiple submissions from the same person by pretending to be a different person.
2.  Submit non-relevant proofs to the Quest instruction.
3.  Plagiarise the content submitted.
4.  Frequently appeal to the Maker without any valid appeal reasons.
5.  Frequently interrupt the Quest operation by the Maker or the conduct of business.
6.  for any other reason(s) that may harm on the overall Reviewhunt website and business operation.

Even if you are blacklisted, you can still use our platform as a maker (creating quests), however, you won't be able to receive Rewards from your Quest approval and withdraw the USD Point displaying on My Credit section. We announce the blacklist via #blacklist channel in our [Discord Group](https://discord.gg/mFe5GPy) . You can also appeal via #reviewhunt channel if you think you did not commit any of the actions above.

## Fees & Services

We charge two types of fees to a Maker who creates a Quest as below:

1.  Operation fee: Reviewhunt charges an 8% operation fee across all Quest Budgets. Please note that you may have a different operation fee if agreed upon by you and Reviewhunt.
2.  Accounting ⁄ Conversion fee: Reviewhunt charges an additional 12% fee across all Quest Budgets for processing accounting procedures and⁄or converting between fiat and cryptographic currencies.

We may choose to temporarily change the fees for our services for promotional events (for example, discounts on memberships) or new services, and such changes are effective when we post a temporary promotional event or new service on the Website, or through promotional correspondence.

We may, from time to time, and without notice, change or add to the fees.

## Quest Creation, Operation & Expiration

Quest is a general mission created by a Maker so that Hunters can perform a certain task for the product. There are multiple Quest categories as below that the Maker can choose from:

1.  Download ⁄ Activities
2.  Channel Boost
3.  Social ⁄ Blog Review
4.  App Store Review
5.  Survey
6.  Custom Quest

It is the Makers responsibility to fully understand each Quest category, and choose the right category for the task mission that the Maker set. Reviewhunt has no liability or responsibility for the misled or low quality Quest submissions due to the wrong category choice. The categories may be updated or deleted from time to time, and without notice.

A Maker must read and agree to the Makers Guidelines before joining a Quest. We have no responsibility to any unwanted results that are caused because the Maker did not follow, or violated the rules outlined in the Makers Guidelines.

It is the Makers responsibility to provide well-written Quest Instructions for the Hunters who join and perform the Quest. The instruction must be simple and clear to understand, and describe all necessary information that the Hunter should know to provide the right Quest Proof. Makers are also responsible to provide a clear screenshot example that is approachable from the Hunter.

Product or Subject Link that the Maker provides on the Quest description must be a valid and not a fraudulent link.

All Proof submissions from Hunters who joined the Quest will be appeared on the Maker Dashboard section when a Maker runs a Quest. Makers must complete the moderation process (approve or reject) for each submission within 72 hours from the submitted date. If the Maker fails to approve⁄reject within the period, the Proof submission will be automatically approved, and the result is irreversible.

Makers can only reject hunter's submission based on what the Maker has required in the Quest Instruction. Makers must provide a valid reason to reject the submission. If we receive an appeal from a Hunter whose rejection reason was not clearly described on the Quest Instruction, we may change the moderation result.

Makers may receive an appeal request from the Hunter whose Proof submission got rejected via the registered email. The Maker must respond to the appeal request and reply with a fair reason to reject, or change the moderation result. If the Quest instruction does not clearly address the reason of rejection, you are not able to reject the submission, so you need to approve the submission. If not, we may change the moderation result.

You must be aware that your Quest activities may affect on your social⁄blog channels. Your Quest missions may violate the terms or policy of some other services, which may result in a suspension of the account. We have no responsibility or liability for any results in your social⁄blog accounts such as suspension or deletion.

From the Quest operation, you may encounter an abusive or not preferable user. We have no responsibility or liability for any effects on your product⁄service operation from the user.

A Quest reward will be distributed automatically to the Hunter's My Credit after 4 hours from the time when the Maker approve the Proof submission. The Quest will expire when there is not sufficient budget left to accept more Hunters to join. In this case, the Maker can add more budget to keep running the Quest. If not, the Quest will be finished.

A Maker is responsible to set the right amount of the Quest Reward based on the level of completion. A reward that is too low may result in a low number of participants, which result in delaying Quest completion. In that case, the Maker is required to increase the Quest Reward. For the refund information about your quest budget as a Maker, please refer to the <link to="/refund-policy">Refund Policy.
