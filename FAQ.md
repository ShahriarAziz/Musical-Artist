### How to change my email address?
```
Please send us:
1. Your old Reviewhunt email address
2. New email address you want to change to
```

###  I share the same IP address with other family members. Could my account get banned or my trust score gets decreased?
```
We don’t suspend accounts simply because we found other accounts using the same IP. Account can only get blacklisted if we found a clear evidence of activity that violates our terms and you seriously damaged our core value of the platform. 
We know it’s a common situation that many people share the same IP address, and few accounts from the same IP won’t affect on your Trust Score at all.
```

### How can I delete my account?
```
You can find “Delete Account” button on the bottom of “Settings” menu
Thanks for using Reviewhunt, and hope you come back in the future.
```

###  How to deposit USD point on my wallet?
```
We don't take dollar deposit on your account. Your USD point wallet is only used for receiving rewards from completing quests.
If you want to run a quest as a maker, you should make a payment for each quest at the end of the quest creation steps.
```

### I only approved X submissions, but the reward reduced more than that (or the quest becomes completed status after reward become $0)
```
The reward pool is reserved when the hunter "joined" your quest, and they have 24 hours maximum until they submit the quest proof.

If you approve the quest submission, the "reserved reward amount" is paid to the hunters, but
if you reject the quest submission, the "reserved reward amount" goes back to the quest reward pool.
Also, if the hunter doesn't submit their quest proof within 24 hours, their reserve status is cancelled and the reserved amount goes back to the quest reward pool.
```

### I forgot my password
```
You can reset your password on https://review.hunt.town/forgot_password.
```

### I didn't get my reward
```
The quest reward is sent after 4 hours from the quest maker approve your submission, 
and the maker has up to 72 hours until he/she finishes reviewing your submission.

If the maker doesn’t review your submission within 72 hours, it will be approved automatically by the system.

Thanks,
```

### Why my TrustScore is too low?
```
Trust score is a measurable index that demonstrates how trustworthy a hunter is in relation to Reviewhunt activities. It is calculated based on alt account operation, approval rate of submissions, and more. This score updates on a daily basis.

If your submission approval rate is good, but your trust score is too low, it's probably our system detected you operates multiple alt accounts.

Thanks,
```

### How can i deposit money into your account?
```
If you want to run your quest on Reviewhunt, you can simply create a quest and there is a payment options at the end of the quest creation steps.

You can pay the quest with your credit card or crypto currencies (HUNT, ETH, BTC, STEEM)

Thanks,
```
### I want to know how to work on this website
```
Reviewhunt is a platform that users can receive rewards by completing marketing quests.
You can also post your own marketing quests to other users (hunters).

Basic flow as a hunter is:
1. Find a quest you would like to join on the main page of the Reviewhunt (https://review.hunt.town)
2. Join the quest using "Join Quest" button on the right side of the quest detail page
3. Read the quest instruction carefully and upload your quest proof within 24 hours from joining.
4. The quest maker has 72 hours till they review your submission. If the maker doesn't finish the moderation, your submission will be automatically approved.
5. Your reward will be send within 4 hours from your submission approved.
6. You can withdraw your Credit Balance (USD Point) from "My Credit" page (we currently support HUNT or ETH token withdrawal).

Thanks,
```

### My withdrawal is pending
```
Currently we're having an issue with ETH withdrawal due to a huge traffic on ETH network. 
It will be resolved in few hours.

Thank you for your patience.
```

### How can I withdraw? what's the withdrawal address?
```
Currently you can withdraw your balance in a crypto currency (HUNT token or Etherem token).
You can exchange those tokens into your fiat money using a crypto currency exchange.
Currently HUNT token is only listed on Daybit (https://daybit.com)
And ETH (Ethereum) is listed on most exchanges in the world. For Indonesian users, check out:

### How can I change my email address?
```
We can only change your email address if you mistyped your email address on sign-up.
If your old email is already verified, we're not able to change your email address as it's being used as a unique ID on Reviewhunt.

If you mistyped your email address on sign-up, please send us:
1. Your old Reviewhunt email address signed up on Reviewhunt
2. New email address you want to change to
via admin@hunt.town
```

### What's the minimum withdrawal fee?
```
There’s no minimum withdrawal amount, but there's a withdrawal fee of $0.2.
So you can technically withdraw from $0.21, but better with larger amount at once.
```
