# Refund Policy

By using Reviewhunt as a Maker who creates a Quest, you are covered by this refund policy as follows:

Only the total reward fund (also called the "Total Quest Budget") is refundable. The conversion/accounting and operation fees are not refundable in any case.

The quest rewards that are already allocated for hunters in the middle of, or who have completed the quests are not refundable. You can find out how much of your quest budget remains by checking the "Remaining Balance" section.

When you request a refund, there will be an applied daily deduction to your refundable amount to prevent a quest running too long in a low quality way. See below for details:

Before starting your Quest: If you have not started your Quest yet, you can get a full refund of the Total Quest Budget.

After starting your Quest: Once you have started your Quest (which means that you have clicked the "Start Now" button on your Maker Dashboard), your refundable amount will be calculated based on the "Remaining Balance" minus the daily deduction, which is calculated by 1/30th each day. For example, if your Remaining Balance is $80 and your Quest has started 5 days ago, your refundable amount will be $66 based on this calculation $80 x (1 - 5/30). 30 days after you begin your quest listing you will have no refundable balance left.

Please note that you can only request a refund after meeting the following conditions:

1. You should pause the quest.
2. All pending hunters who have joined the quest but did not submit their proof yet must be moderated. It may take up to 24 hours after pausing your quest for the pending hunters to complete the quest.
3. You should finish all the moderation properly.

Once your quest has met the criteria above, the "Request Refund" button will be active and you can claim your refundable amount. The refund will be processed via the same method of payment. The conversion rate is calculated based on the average market price in the previous 24 hours.
